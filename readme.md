# You-me-JC 2019 website

Simplish fake chatbot, that doesnt need all the complicated type-timer I added at core ;) 

Portfolio site that directs `contact` | `links` | `skills`  via a chatbot that imitates me.

Chatbot uses a _storygraph_ to follow the chat routes..

Storygraph is a term coined by yours truly to describe a mutable and multi directional node path that rules the content.

Building a system to generate a storygraph would be amazing. Then another application to consume it would simply be like standing in for someone who was already outstanding.

### TODO

- [x] IO storygraph
- [x] simple styling
- [ ] integrate vuex // bah overkill
- [x] Skills 
- [x] choices component
